## Relevance and Explanation of the Issue

In the wake of the great recession of 2008 and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis, many Member States made sizeable **cuts to defence spending** as part of austerity measures. Between 2006 and 2013 Member States {% tooltip  European Defence Agency (2015). Defence Data 2013. Page 10.

This development however stands in strong contrast with recent developments regarding the EU’s Eastern neighbours: Russian **aggressions** in Ukraine and Georgia, now-regular {% tooltip  European Leadership Network (2015).

Besides Member States, the {% tooltip  Reuters (2014).

In order to improve the cost efficiency of Member States’ armed forces, and to strengthen the EU’s international influence {% tooltip  The Telegraph (2015). Create an EU army to keep back the Russians, Jean-Claude Juncker suggests. Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11457872/Create-an-EU-army-to-keep-back-the-Russians-Jean-Claude-Juncker-suggests.html'>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11457872/Create-an-EU-army-to-keep-back-the-Russians-Jean-Claude-Juncker-suggests.html</a> %} through **the acquisition of military power**{% endtooltip %}, some have proposed increased European military cooperation and integration as a solution. Largely, such defence integration can be split up into two distinct categories: {% tooltip  International military policy integration refers to Member States coordinating international operations and policy - primarily to carry out tasks similar in nature to the Petersberg tasks. %} **international military policy integration** {% endtooltip %} and {% tooltip  Military capability integration is where Member States coordinate their national armed forces and their actual operations in terms of equipment, interoperability, organisation, and common exercises. %} **military capability integration**{% endtooltip %}. Roughly, these categories correspond to integration in terms of international and national policy. The EU today possesses some military capabilities under the **Common Security and Defence Policy** (CSDP) in the form of {% tooltip  EU Battlegroups are military units consisting of contributions from the armed forces of one or typically multiple member states. They are intended to be deployable on very short notice to carry out missions under the Petersberg tasks (see below), upon decision by the Council of the EU. %} **EU Battlegroups**{% endtooltip %}, although their status as true EU resources is debatable as they are national military units temporarily held ready for EU usage.

A shift towards further granting the EU its own military capabilities is not a simple matter of efficitivisation and rationalisation, but rather a question of whether - and if so to what extent - military power is compatible with the EU’s founding principle of peace through cooperation and integration.

Although the EU historically has been an organisation mainly working internally with its Member States’ trade and other matters, {% tooltip  The six Member States not members of NATO are Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Malta. %} all but six{% endtooltip %} of the EU’s current Member States are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), an organisation that historically has served to strive for peace by strengthening military cooperation regarding its members’ territorial defence.

This raises the question of whether the EU primarily should create its own frameworks for military integration and cooperation, or if its focus should be put on improving cooperation within the already existing NATO structure.

## Key Questions

* Is acquiring military capabilities - directly or indirectly - ideologically compatible with the EU’s founding principle of peace through European integration?

* Would further military integration within the EU be at all desirable, or is military power best handled directly by Member States?

* If found to be desirable, under which conditions and by which means should military integration take place?

* Should the EU primarily focus be on creating its own structures for military cooperation, or strengthening cooperation with NATO?

* How could decision making regarding common military capabilities be handled efficiently within the EU’s legal framework?

## Key Actors

The **European External Action Service** (EEAS) serves as the diplomatic corps of the EU, responsible for carrying out the EU’s foreign policy as agreed upon unanimously by Member States. The overall aim of the EEAS is to make European foreign policy more synchronised and thereby more effective. Notably, foreign policy decisions within the EU is only handled by the **Council of the EU** and not by the European Parliament as is common for many other policy fields. In terms of **competence**, the EU has the competence to conduct a common foreign and security policy. Said policy is however required to be agreed upon unanimously in the Council of the EU, meaning that the EU cannot influence the foreign policy of a Member State against its will. Defence policy is not at all a competence of the EU, meaning that Member States are free to decide upon policy themselves.

The EU’s **Member States** are at the very center of the EU, and between Member States foreign policy interests and priorities may sometimes align but sometimes diverge. {% tooltip  The Telegraph (2015). Merkel 'expects Cameron to back EU army' in exchange for renegotiation. Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11861247/Merkel-expects-Cameron-to-back-EU-army-in-exchange-for-renegotiation.html'>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11861247/Merkel-expects-Cameron-to-back-EU-army-in-exchange-for-renegotiation.html</a> %} Some Member States are enthusiastic{% endtooltip %} about EU military cooperation, whilst others are less so - for example Denmark has a {% tooltip  Denmark’s opt-out from the CDSP means that Denmark is not obligated to adhere to the CSDP. As a consequence, Denmark is excluded from foreign policy discussions and decisions with defence implications. %} **permanent opt-out**{% endtooltip %} from the CSDP. Additionally some Member States, such as the Netherlands and Germany, cooperate bilaterally and have for example {% tooltip  Foreign Affairs (2016). The Military Sharing Economy. Retrieved from: <a href='https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2016-03-07/military-sharing-economy'>https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2016-03-07/military-sharing-economy</a> %} integrated military units.{% endtooltip %} Member States enjoy full command over their own military forces; whatever power the EU might have over for example its Battlegroups is only derived from Member States’ voluntary commitments.

The **North Atlantic Treaty Organisation** (NATO), unifying 22 Member States and six non-Member States in a military alliance dated 1949, serves to guarantee its members security and freedom through political and military cooperation. Due to the large overlap in membership between NATO and the EU there can also be said to be a sizeable overlap of interests: both NATO and the EU strive to maintain security in Europe. However, as some NATO members are not EU Member States, such countries - {% tooltip  The National Interest (2010). It All Comes Back to Hegemony. Retreived from: <a href='http://nationalinterest.org/node/4454'>http://nationalinterest.org/node/4454</a> %} for example the US - also take interest {% endtooltip %} in the the EU’s defence policy. In 1998 former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright famously framed what the US wanted the EU to keep away from the CDSP in the three D’s: no duplication of NATO effort and resources, no decoupling of the US from NATO, and no discrimination against non-EU members (such as Turkey).

The **Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe**(OSCE) is {% tooltip   Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (2016). Participating States. Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.osce.org/states'>http://www.osce.org/states</a> %} an international organisation gathering 57 Member countries {% endtooltip %} that are both European and non-European, with the overall aim of furthering European security in terms of political, military, environmental as well as human security. Much of its work with military security is conducted through the {% tooltip  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (2016). Forum for Security Co-operation. Retrieved from: <a href='http://www.osce.org/fsc'>http://www.osce.org/fsc</a> %} **Forum for Security Cooperation** {% endtooltip %}, providing a platform for amongst other things information exchange  on military policy and budgets, observation of military operations, overseeing the democratic control of military forces, and international discussion on security issues.

## Key Conflicts

A core conflict within this topic is between the EU having military capabilities, and the Union’s founding principle of peace through European integration and cooperation. Although {% tooltip  The EU’s first predecessor was the European Coal and Steel Community. %} the EU’s first predecessor{% endtooltip %} was established in 1951, it was not until the 1990’s that the EU even aspired to gain foreign policy influence. Thus, the the question is whether an organisation so fundamentally rooted with the concepts of peace and cooperation at all should use military power internationally, or if it should constrain itself to {% tooltip  Soft Power is the ability to attract and convince other international actors through non-coercive means such as diplomacy. %} ‘soft power’ {% endtooltip %} and economic sanctions in the foreign policy arena.

Another consideration is between EU influence and Member State influence. Does the burden of defence policy naturally fall upon Member States, or would the EU better handle defence policy and military forces? National sovereignty and the political sensitivity of  defence policy speak for Member States maintaining their power, while shifting power to the EU could  increase cost-efficiency and foreign policy effectivity?

Although foreign policy decisions normally need to be adopted unanimously by the Council of the EU, the CFSP is considered so sensitive that it is formally in the domain of the **European Council**, which gather all Member States’ heads of state or government. It is under the CSDP that many current initiatives are organised, for example {% tooltip  EU Battlegroups are military units consisting of contributions from the armed forces of one or typically multiple member states. They are intended to be deployable on very short notice to carry out missions under the Petersberg tasks (see below), upon decision by the Council of the EU. %} EU Battlegroups {% endtooltip %}.

**Bilateral defence cooperation** exists between some Member States that have agreed to integrate units from their armed forces. For example Germany and France {% tooltip  The Guardian (1988).

**Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and article 42(7) of the Treaty on the European Union** are known as the solidarity clause and the mutual defence clause. Through them Member States are obliged to provide support and assistance if a Member State is subjected to "a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster", and to provide “aid and assistance by all the means in their power” if another Member State is subjected to armed aggression.
