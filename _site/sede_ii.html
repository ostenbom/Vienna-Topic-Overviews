<h2 id="key-actors">Key Actors</h2>

<p>The <strong>European External Action Service</strong> (EEAS) serves as the diplomatic corps of the EU, responsible for carrying out the EU’s foreign policy as agreed upon unanimously by Member States. The overall aim of the EEAS is to make European foreign policy more synchronised and thereby more effective. Notably, foreign policy decisions within the EU is only handled by the <strong>Council of the EU</strong> and not by the European Parliament as is common for many other policy fields. In terms of <strong>competence</strong>, the EU has the competence to conduct a common foreign and security policy. Said policy is however required to be agreed upon unanimously in the Council of the EU, meaning that the EU cannot influence the foreign policy of a Member State against its will. Defence policy is not at all a competence of the EU, meaning that Member States are free to decide upon policy themselves.</p>

<p>The EU’s <strong>Member States</strong> are at the very center of the EU, and between Member States foreign policy interests and priorities may sometimes align but sometimes diverge. <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The Telegraph (2015). Merkel 'expects Cameron to back EU army' in exchange for renegotiation.

As a consequence, Denmark is excluded from foreign policy discussions and decisions with defence implications. "> <strong>permanent opt-out</strong></a> from the CSDP. Additionally some Member States, such as the Netherlands and Germany, cooperate bilaterally and have for example <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Foreign Affairs (2016). The Military Sharing Economy. Retrieved from: &lt;a href='https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2016-03-07/military-sharing-economy'&gt;https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/germany/2016-03-07/military-sharing-economy&lt;/a&gt; "> integrated military units.</a> Member States enjoy full command over their own military forces; whatever power the EU might have over for example its Battlegroups is only derived from Member States’ voluntary commitments.</p>

<p>The <strong>North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</strong> (NATO), unifying 22 Member States and six non-Member States in a military alliance dated 1949, serves to guarantee its members security and freedom through political and military cooperation. Due to the large overlap in membership between NATO and the EU there can also be said to be a sizeable overlap of interests: both NATO and the EU strive to maintain security in Europe. However, as some NATO members are not EU Member States, such countries - <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The National Interest (2010). It All Comes Back to Hegemony.

In 1998 former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright famously framed what the US wanted the EU to keep away from the CDSP in the three D’s: no duplication of NATO effort and resources, no decoupling of the US from NATO, and no discrimination against non-EU members (such as Turkey).</p>

<p>The <strong>Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe</strong>(OSCE) is <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (2016).

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>A core conflict within this topic is between the EU having military capabilities, and the Union’s founding principle of peace through European integration and cooperation. Although <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The EU’s first predecessor was the European Coal and Steel Community. "> the EU’s first predecessor</a> was established in 1951, it was not until the 1990’s that the EU even aspired to gain foreign policy influence. Thus, the the question is whether an organisation so fundamentally rooted with the concepts of peace and cooperation at all should use military power internationally, or if it should constrain itself to <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Soft Power is the ability to attract and convince other international actors through non-coercive means such as diplomacy. "> ‘soft power’ </a> and economic sanctions in the foreign policy arena.</p>

<p>Another consideration is between EU influence and Member State influence. Does the burden of defence policy naturally fall upon Member States, or would the EU better handle defence policy and military forces? National sovereignty and the political sensitivity of  defence policy speak for Member States maintaining their power, while shifting power to the EU could  increase cost-efficiency and foreign policy effectivity?</p>

<p><strong>Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and article 42(7) of the Treaty on the European Union</strong> are known as the solidarity clause and the mutual defence clause. Through them Member States are obliged to provide support and assistance if a Member State is subjected to “a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster”, and to provide “aid and assistance by all the means in their power” if another Member State is subjected to armed aggression.

The overlaps in membership between NATO and the EU, which has the CSDP, caused concerns about the duplication of assets and structures, which resulted in the Berlin Plus agreement to divide responsibilities for crisis management. Amongst other things, the agreement provides a structure for the EU to utilise NATO resources and assets for EU-led crisis management operations and guarantees the EU access to NATO planning capabilities.</p>
