<p><em>by Kathi Radler, Member of EYP Austria’s Academic Quality Team 2015/16</em></p>

<p>Did you ever wonder how EU legislation is made? The European problems we agree on in just a couple of days are a matter of quite difficult processes in reality. You probably already got in touch with the institutions, the procedures and the competences of the European Union, but as it is a quite complicated system, the next section aims at refreshing your memory about its institutions and their most important activities.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-council">The European Council</h2>
<p><img src="img/council.png" alt="The European Council" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px; max-width: 300px;" />Let’s start with the European Council: It consists of the <strong>heads of state or government</strong> and the President of the European Commission. The president of the European Council is elected for 2.5 years and is currently <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> from Poland, who must report to the European Parliament after each meeting. <strong>4 times a year they</strong> all meet in <strong>Brussels</strong>, in order to discuss the <strong>general goals</strong> of the next year. It therefore does not really propose legislations - for example, in their last meeting this march they decided on general directions for an Energy Union in the EU and external relations with Russia and Ukraine, among other topics.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-commission">The European Commission</h2>
<p><img src="img/commission.png" alt="The European Commission" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px; max-width: 300px;" />The European Commission is the <strong>only institution empowered to initiate legislation</strong>. Nevertheless, also the European Parliament, as well as member states and citizens (&gt; 100.000 citizens from at least seven different EU countries) can ask the European Commission to submit a proposal.</p>

<p>Consisting of <strong>28 Commissioners of every member country</strong>, the European Commission furthermore manages the EU-budget and allocates the funding, <strong>enforces EU law</strong> together with the Court of Justice and <strong>represents the EU internationally</strong>. But the European Commission also has its limitations – they are not allowed to command troops, raise taxes or decide on foreign policies, as this is under the power of national legislation.
The commissioners are supported by their <strong>“Directorate Generals”</strong>, which are divided into different areas, such as administration, law, economists or translators. Current president of the European Commission is <strong>Jean Claude Juncker</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="council-of-the-european-union">Council of the European Union</h2>
<p><img src="img/parliament.png" alt="Council of the European Union" style="float: right; margin-left: 7px;margin-top: 7px; max-width: 300px;" />But we already had… No, wait – the European Council and the Council of the European Union are two different institutions. To make it even more puzzling: it is also not the Council of Europe – this is not an EU institution at all…</p>

<p>Let’s stop the confusion and get started: The Council of the European Union consists of the <strong>ministers of every Member State</strong>, therefore it is also referred to as the <strong>“Council of Ministers”</strong>. It is not presided by a person, but by a state that rotates every six months. Currently this is Latvia.</p>

<p>They have quite a lot to do - under their main tasks you find: <strong>passing the EU laws</strong> jointly with the European Parliament, approving the EU budget, <strong>coordinating the broad economic policies</strong> of the EU member countries, <strong>signing agreements between the EU and other countries, developing the EU’s foreign and defence policies</strong> and the <strong>coordination of cooperation between courts and police forces</strong> of member countries.</p>

<h2 id="the-european-parliament">The European Parliament</h2>
<p>Sounds familiar? The namesake of our European Youth Parliament consists of <strong>751 members, directly elected by the EU’s citizens every 5 years</strong>. They gather into different <strong>fractions according to their political stance</strong>. Since the last election in 2014, the <strong>European People’s Party</strong> (Centre-Right) hast the most seats, followed by the <strong>Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats</strong> (Centre-Left). President of the European Parliament is <strong>Martin Schulz</strong> from Germany.</p>

<p>The European Parliament works closely together with the European Commission, as they both have a say on the <strong>EU budget</strong> and jointly have to <strong>decide on EU laws</strong>. Furthermore, they <strong>scrutinise other EU institutions</strong>, in order to ensure that they are working democratically.</p>
