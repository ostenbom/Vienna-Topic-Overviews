  <h2 id="relevance-and-explanation-of-the-issue">Relevance and Explanation of the Issue</h2>

<p>The so-called Islamic State (aka ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, IS) has become one of the foremost threats to European and OSCE States in the current geo-political sphere. ISIS holds  a swathe of territory across the Iraqi-Syrian border and has inspired terrorist attacks in a number of States including France, Turkey, Yemen and Belgium. It has amassed an army that comprises of around <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Telegraph (2016) Iraq and Syria: How many foreign fighters are fighting for Isil? &lt;a href='http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/iraq-and-syria-how-many-foreign-fighters-are-fighting-for-isil/'&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/iraq-and-syria-how-many-foreign-fighters-are-fighting-for-isil/&lt;/a&gt; "> 30,000 foreign fighters from over 80 countries </a> and armed itself with a mixture of high tech US weapons plundered from Iraqi bases and small arms smuggled from a number of illicit sources, even <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Financial Times (2016) The munitions trail &lt;a href='http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/baad34e4-973c-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html#axzz45eF6IeRv'&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/baad34e4-973c-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc.html#axzz45eF6IeRv&lt;/a&gt; "> from within the Syrian Army itself </a>.</p>

<p>Yet the clarity with which the ISIS threat is perceived is counteracted by discord and confusion in how to deal with, or even define, the group. ISIS is both a religious creation, a group mutated from Al-Qaida in Iraq following ideological differences and a political entity. An entity created to exploit weak security in the region and supported by those who oppose the Iraqi Shi’ite government, namely Sunni tribes and opportunistic members of <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Reuters (2015) How Saddam’s men help Islamic State rule &lt;a href='http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/'&gt;http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/&lt;/a&gt; "> Saddam Hussein’s exiled Ba’ath Party </a>. It could be seen as a fledgling State, with taxation, supply chains and law enforcement. It is also the embodiment of an extremist ideology that inspires its followers.</p>

<p>Combatting ISIS requires a holistic approach that tackles all of these identities, yet each avenue brings a unique challenge. The will for military intervention by OSCE participating States is soured by the Afghanistan and Iraq experience. Economic pressure, largely exerted through tactical air strikes, damages the local economy and population. Radicalisation and the prospect of returning fighters continues to be an issue that is dealt with on a <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Quilliam Foundation Blog (2015) Islamic State Abroad: How can we deal with returning fighters? &lt;a href='http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/blog/islamic-state-abroad-how-can-we-deal-with-returning-fighters/'&gt;http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/blog/islamic-state-abroad-how-can-we-deal-with-returning-fighters/&lt;/a&gt;  "> national, not international basis</a>, possibly a result of States not wanting to air dirty laundry in public.</p>

<p>Consistency and coherency is in short supply in international responses to the ISIS threat. Who should supply that coherency, and what this international strategy should be, is still very much up for debate.</p>

<p><strong>OSCE</strong></p>

<p>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe actually comprises of 57 States including Russia and the United States. As a forum for political discussion and coordination it is well placed to help facilitate a coherent international response to the threat of ISIS, as well as supporting expertise and training in a range of areas such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="OSCE Border control capabilities &lt;a href='http://www.osce.org/what/borders'&gt;http://www.osce.org/what/borders&lt;/a&gt; ">border control</a> and <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="OSCE Counterterrorism &lt;a href='http://www.osce.org/what/terrorism'&gt;http://www.osce.org/what/terrorism&lt;/a&gt; ">counterterrorism</a>.</p>

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>The options for physical action against between ISIS is understood best when contextualised with the following ideological conflicts and realities on the ground:</p>

<h3 id="the-appetite-for-international-military-intervention-vs-its-necessity">The appetite for international military intervention vs its necessity</h3>

<p>One of the critical impasses in international responses to ISIS is balancing the need for military action with the lessons of failed intervention in the Middle East. Current airstrikes have checked ISIS, but it will not destroy the group. The history of bombing campaigns not only show that civilian casualties are virtually inevitable, but that even unprecedented scale cannot guarantee results - the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The Atlantic (2013) What the U.S. Bombing of Cambodia Tells Us About Obama's Drone Campaign &lt;a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/what-the-us-bombing-of-cambodia-tells-us-about-obamas-drone-campaign/273142/'&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/what-the-us-bombing-of-cambodia-tells-us-about-obamas-drone-campaign/273142/&lt;/a&gt; "> US Cambodian campaign in the late 60’s is testament to this</a>.</p>

<p>Yet protracted land campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan cost the lives of thousands of soldiers and still didn’t deliver lasting security. Poor post-war planning and sectarian violence in Iraq fuelled the rise of ISIS itself, and the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="CNN (2016) Anger as Afghan troops pull out of parts of Helmand province &lt;a href='http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/22/asia/afghanistan-helmand-military/index.html'&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/22/asia/afghanistan-helmand-military/index.html&lt;/a&gt; "> Taliban have gained much of the ground fought for in Afghanistan</a>. More recently, Barack Obama has admitted that the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="BBC News (2016) President Obama: Libya aftermath 'worst mistake' of presidency &lt;a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36013703'&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-36013703&lt;/a&gt; "> failure to plan for a post-Gaddafi Libya was the biggest mistake of his presidency</a>. With ISIS growing in the power vacuum of Libya, there is a stark reminder of the complexity, and difficulty, of military intervention.</p>

<h3 id="balancing-international-interests">Balancing International interests</h3>

<p>The second key conflict to remember is the inherent need to coordinate an international response to the ISIS threat that reflects the number of competing national and international interests in the region.</p>

<p>Iran’s interests in the Middle East have always been at odds with those of Saudi Arabia. Both take on the mantle as protector for their own branch of Islam, whether it be Iran’s defence of Shi’a muslims or Saudi Arabia’s proliferation of Wahabi strands of SUnni Islam. Iran has subsequently <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Global Public Policy Watch (2015) The Persian Puppeteer: Iran puling strings in Syria and across the Middle East &lt;a href='https://globalpublicpolicywatch.org/2015/11/22/the-persian-puppeteer-iran-pulling-strings-in-syria-and-across-the-middle-east/'&gt;https://globalpublicpolicywatch.org/2015/11/22/the-persian-puppeteer-iran-pulling-strings-in-syria-and-across-the-middle-east/&lt;/a&gt; "> supported Iraq’s enfeebled Shia government in the fight against ISIS</a>. Saudi Arabia by contrast has been criticised for allegedly <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="International Business Times (2014) ISIS Weapons Growing In Number, Sophistication: A Soviet, Balkan And American Mix, But The Group Can't Use All Of Them &lt;a href='http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-weapons-growing-number-sophistication-soviet-balkan-american-mix-group-cant-use-all-1659176'&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/isis-weapons-growing-number-sophistication-soviet-balkan-american-mix-group-cant-use-all-1659176&lt;/a&gt; "> supplying weapons to the Sunni tribes that fight with ISIS</a>. With ISIS suicide attacks in Iraq aimed at dividing religious groups further, efforts must be made to prevent further sectarian tension and the restoration of security that does not provoke Iranian or Saudi Arabian ambition.</p>

<p>Russia’s intervention in the Syrian Civil War is also a warning of conflicting aims amongst OSCE participating States. All OSCE States are committed to the destruction of ISIS, but Russia’s ambition to maintain it’s warm water port in Syria also links back to its <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The Atlantic (2015) The Link Between Putin’s Military Campaigns in Syria and Ukraine &lt;a href='http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/navy-base-syria-crimea-putin/408694/'&gt;http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/navy-base-syria-crimea-putin/408694/&lt;/a&gt; ">occupation of Crimea</a>.

The world beyond the civil war and ISIS is also a source of international tension for Turkey. Ankara is vehemently opposed to the Kurdish independence movement, and labels many Kurd groups as terrorists. They have <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="BBC News (2016) Turkey v Syria's Kurds v Islamic State &lt;a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33690060'&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-33690060&lt;/a&gt; "> stepped up bombing against the Syrian Kurds</a>, attacking the very group that are also fighting ISIS.
