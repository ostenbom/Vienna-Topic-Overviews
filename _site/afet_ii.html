  <h2 id="relevance-and-explanation-of-the-issue">Relevance and Explanation of the Issue</h2>

<p>At the moment there are many conflicts happening all around the world and the Russian Federation plays a part in many of them. Conflicts in post-soviet countries often involve separatist movements aimed at breaking away from one of the successor states and often they end without a peaceful resolution and are referred as frozen conflicts. Rebel groups are essentially left free to control large chunks of the territories they claim and state governments do not exercise full control over areas still under the control of rebels, thus creating chaos in the country. Since 1990 Russia was involved in a number of heated conflicts in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Moldova and most recently Ukraine.</p>

<p>These actions by the Russian Federation do not go unnoticed and are condemned by the western world. The annexed territories such as Crimea are not recognized by the majority of UN Member States. Actions committed by Russia were recognised as opposing various international laws and treaties such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Article 2 §4 of the Charter of the United Nations founds the principles of the inviolability of the States’ territorial integrity and the prohibition of the use of force 	&lt;a href='https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CTC/uncharter.pdf'&gt;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CTC/uncharter.pdf&lt;/a&gt; ">the Charter of the United Nations</a>, <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The Helsinki Conference in 1975 established the respect of the borders in Europe and gave rise to the OSCE.

The EU, NATO and OSCE worked and continue to work together to solve these conflicts; joint delegations are sent to negotiate ceasefires, military presence in the region has increased and independent observers are sent. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the OSCE deployed on-the-ground monitoring missions and teams of human rights monitors throughout the conflict reported numerous violations of human rights and media freedom.</p>

<p>It should be noted that when analysing current conflicts, a centerpiece of modern international law is that a country’s territory changes only by consent, never by force. There is concern that if this rule of territorial stability is compromised, there will be severe repercussions to global stability and statehood.</p>

<h3 id="the-european-union-eu">The European Union (EU)</h3>

<p>Even though, apart from Baltic States and Poland, Member States are not extremely concerned by Russian foreign policy developments, the EU plays a vital role in this issue. The EU has no direct influence over Russia, however the EU has control over the common market and thus can introduce restrictive measures - sanctions. Together with the United States the EU imposed <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="An overview of sanctions imposed can be found here: &lt;a href='https://www.reedsmith.com/files/Publication/9221cf81-e4f7-4907-ab2c-f7dc249eac58/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/441e0ec9-dbd8-4c3a-b1fa-0bf7ed4d5872/alert_14-255.pdf'&gt;https://www.reedsmith.com/files/Publication/9221cf81-e4f7-4907-ab2c-f7dc249eac58/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/441e0ec9-dbd8-4c3a-b1fa-0bf7ed4d5872/alert_14-255.pdf&lt;/a&gt; ">sanctions</a> that focused on Russia’s key defense, energy, and financial service sectors and together with severe drop of oil prices resulted in 2014 - 2015 Financial Crisis in Russia.</p>

<h3 id="organization-for-security-and-co-operation-in-europe-osce">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)</h3>

<p>The world’s largest security-oriented intergovernmental organization that has a comprehensive approach to security that encompasses politico-military and economic aspects. Some of the areas that OSCE focuses are border management, conflict prevention and resolution, economic activities and democratization. Decisions are made by finding a consensus and are not legally binding.</p>

<h3 id="united-nations-security-council-unsc">United Nations Security Council (UNSC)</h3>

<p>Under the Charter of United Nations its primary responsibility is for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council consists of 15 Members five of them (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States) are permanent and have the power to veto any resolution. The Council has the power to take military action against an aggressor, call on Members to apply economic sanctions and other measures not involving the use of force to prevent or stop aggression and more.</p>

<h3 id="north-atlantic-treaty-organisation-nato">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)</h3>

<p>A political and military alliance consisting of 28 Member States with the purpose to safeguard the freedom and security of its members through political and military means. <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Article 5: 'an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against all of them'.

<h3 id="national-governments">National Governments</h3>

<p>Even with all the supranational organisations, the national governments of affected countries are still the main stakeholders in the issue. It is up to Ukraine, Georgia and others to take measures regarding their national security.</p>

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>The clear existence of international laws’ and human rights’ infringement seen in heated conflicts between Russia and Georgia and Ukraine cannot be left unsettled.
