<p>The majority of refugees are taking a route through Turkey to enter Europe. To reach the shores, the refugees often end up in deals with human traffickers who take them across treacherous waters, in inadequate vessels, with little guarantee they will make it off alive. The few who do make it then often face long, painstaking trips on foot with little motivation other than to get as far away from that coastline as possible. It is also important to note that while all refugees are migrants, not all migrants are refugees.</p>

<p>The journeys are, again, only part of the problem. When these people arrive in Turkey, or Greece, or other Balkan regions, they seem to stir up quite a bit of social unrest. This is not entirely down to their actions, so much as it is the vast numbers of them. Their arrival seems to be a breeding ground for fear and segregation within an ever de-stabilising Europe. Germany has stated that all refugees are welcome and have adjusted their policies accordingly, while Hungary builds a fence around its border. Throw the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="The Schengen area represents a territory where the free movement of persons is guaranteed. The signatory states to the agreement have abolished all internal borders in lieu of a single external border. ">Schengen Agreement</a>  into the mix, and it seems unlikely we will come to a solution anytime soon. The Dublin III Regulation is probably the most prominent system of remedial measures in place regarding this crisis. The system establishes a hierarchy of criteria for identifying the Member States responsible for examination of an asylum claim in Europe. The aim of the Regulation is to ensure that one Member State is responsible for the examination of an asylum application, to deter multiple asylum claims and to determine as quickly as possible the responsible Member State to ensure effective access to an asylum procedure. There is more about the Dublin III Regulation later in the overview.</p>

<p>Essentially, one of the key conflicts facing Europe is where the line should be drawn between the EU’s self-interests and the upholding of its promise of being a leading example of inclusive and responsible democracy.</p>

<h2 id="key-facts--figures">Key Facts &amp; Figures</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>3,573 migrants died in the Mediterranean attempting to reach Europe in 2015. That is an average of ten people per day. As with most figures from the crisis, the numbers are already significantly increased for 2016.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>0 (or very close to it) - The number of Syrian refugees who have been formally resettled in the wealthy states of the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Germany had by far the highest number of applications in 2015, with 441,800 people claiming asylum in the country, according to figures from the EU’s statistics agency.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-actors">Key Actors</h2>

<p>At the top of the scale we have the <strong>EU</strong> and the <strong>European Commission</strong>. The EU has the <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Eurospeak for decisionmaking power. Since the Treaty of Lisbon, competences of the EU are listed in the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) ">competence</a> to lay down the conditions of entry and residence for third-country nationals entering and legally residing in one Member State for purposes of family reunification. <strong>Member States</strong> still retain the right to determine admission rates for people coming from third countries to seek work. The EU may provide incentives and support for measures taken by Member States to promote the  integration of legally resident third-country nationals; however, there is <em>no provision for harmonisation of national laws and regulations</em>. They are also required to prevent and reduce <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="An irregular migrant is a person who comes to the EU without a proper visa or permit or who overstays after the expiry of their visa  "> irregular immigration </a> , in particular by means of an effective return policy, with due respect for fundamental rights. In the autumn of 2015, the European Commission adopted a “scheme for relocation and resettlement”, known in the media as the “Asylum Quota”. Those <em>“in clear need of international protection”</em> within the EU will be relocated from Hungary, Greece and Italy. This is to be done according to a distribution key mainly based on the population and GDP of the Member States.</p>

<p>On a slightly smaller scale, but equally as important, we have the <strong>UNHCR</strong>, <strong>FRONTEX</strong>, the ** Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)** and the <strong>International Organisation for Migration (IOM)</strong>. The work of the UNHCR was mentioned earlier on. <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="FRONTEX’s full title is the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union. ">FRONTEX</a> are an organisation who promote, coordinate, and develop European border management in line with the EU fundamental rights charter. IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration. They aim to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist however possible in the search for practical solutions to the crisis and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need- including refugees and IDPs. The OECD’s mission is to promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of citizens around the world. Their work has involved monitoring recent developments in migratory movements and policies within OECD countries, as well as analysing integration policies of immigrants and their children into both education and labour markets. The work of the OECD has thus far shown that migration, when effectively managed, has a positive role in the economy spurring innovation and growth.</p>

<p>One of the primary stakeholders in this issue however are the individual Member States themselves. Asylum applications are processed on a national level and those whose applications are granted must settle down in the country which accepted their application. On a supranational level, there is the <strong>Dublin III Agreement</strong> overseeing this application process, there will be more about this in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="key-conflicts">Key Conflicts</h2>

<p>The lack of a common EU immigration system has prompted Member States to adopt their own, short-term solutions, tailored to the demands and preferences of their own country, without recognising the impact this might have on neighbouring countries that share a common travel area. One of the biggest conflicts of this crisis stems from one of the few measures currently in place to fix it. As previously outlined, the migrant applications are being processed on a national level, that is to say, each Member State is responsible for processing the applications of the migrants whose initial landing spot in Europe is that particular country. The conflict arises with the <strong>Schengen Agreement</strong>. This agreement essentially abolished most of the EU’s internal borders, enabling passport-free movement across most of the block.</p>

<p><br />

<br /></p>

<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.stratfor.com/image/map-schengen-countries">stratfor</a></em></p>

<p>So, a migrant’s asylum application will be processed in the country they first land in, but because of Schengen they are entitled to free movement internally in Europe. However, while they may fill the applications criteria in one Member State, they may fall short of standards in another. It also has led to many migrants applying for asylum in countries with the easiest criteria to pass with, such as <a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="Germany received over six times as many applicants for asylum as the UK in 2014, and twice as many as any other country. &lt;a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/11/which-eu-countries-receive-the-most-asylum-seekers'&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/may/11/which-eu-countries-receive-the-most-asylum-seekers&lt;/a&gt; ">Germany</a> or Sweden, and then moving to where they actually want to settle.</p>

<h2 id="measures-in-place">Measures in place</h2>

<p>In March of this year, <strong>Turkey and the EU signed an agreement on the migrant crisis</strong>. Under this agreement, migrants who illegally enter arrive at Europe’s borders via the Balkan route will be sent back to Turkey to await the results of their application procedure there. <em>In exchange for every illegal migrant sent back to Turkey by the EU, one refugee from the Turkish camps will be allowed to legally enter the EU,</em> and will be resettled under the aforementioned scheme. It is also likely that Turkey will receive up to €3 billion from the EU for the accommodation and hospitality of migrants headed for more central Europe.</p>

<p>Another measure in place is the current <strong>Dublin III Regulation</strong>. The system establishes a hierarchy of criteria for identifying which Member State should handle an application. Firstly, if an asylum seeker has family ties within an EU/<a href="#" onclick="return false;" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-content="European Economic Area &lt;a href='https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/'&gt;https://www.djei.ie/en/What-We-Do/Jobs-Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/Employment-Permit-Eligibility/Who-needs-an-Employment-Permit-/European-Economic-Area-EEA-/&lt;/a&gt; ">EEA</a> country, this country is responsible for handling the application. Secondly, when this is not the case, the Member State responsible for their entry into the territory of the EU/EEA is responsible for the application. This means that one must already be in the EU/EEA to apply for asylum, which has put tremendous pressures on the border countries of the EU, like Greece, Italy and Hungary. It is crucial to note that the Dublin agreement, up to and including its current iteration, aims to provide a coordinating system for the processing of applications. It is <em>not</em> involved in ensuring an equal distribution of migrants among Schengen states, and any attempts to circumnavigate the Dublin III Regulation are the consequence of a failure to establish a quota system within the EU.</p>
