## Relevance and Explanation of the Issue

*"A decade of internecine war in the region had left behind not only a terrible legacy of human losses and material destruction, but also an unprecedented level of traumatization among the population at large, which contributed to a widespread and generalized sense of victimhood on all sides of the conflict.“* -  **{% tooltip Regional Dealing with the Past Advisor, Human Security Division, Swiss FDFA <a href='http://www.osce.org/sg/91622'>http://www.osce.org/sg/91622</a> %}Jonathan Sisson{% endtooltip %}**

* What can be done to more actively involve general citizens in the dialogue towards reconciliation?

* Should there be a common and coherent approach to the issue among international and local actors? If so, how can it be obtained?

* How should the topic of Balkan wars be addressed in educational institutions?

## Key Facts & Figures

* The SAP begun in June 1999, and continued at Thessaloniki Summit in 2003.

* The SAP includes the following measures: {% tooltip As stated at <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/sap_en.htm'>http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/glossary/terms/sap_en.htm</a> %}bilateral SSAs, trade relations, financial assistance and regional cooperation{% endtooltip %}

* As of April 2016, the ICTY has indicted 161 individuals, sentencing 80.

* ICTY sentences consist of for four types of crimes: Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, Violations of the Law or Customs of War and Grave Breaches of the Geneva Conventions.

* The annual budget of {% tooltip EULEX is a civilian mission within Common Security and Defence policy within the European Union.

* The mandate of EULEX ends on June 14th, 2016. The decision to prolong or close the mission is taken by EU Member States, and has not been finalised yet.


## Key Actors

**The EU** has developed a policy that aims to support development of Western Balkan countries with aim of further integrating them with the EU. The **European Parliament (EP)** is the decision-making body of the EU taking responsibility for the{% tooltip Further reading:<a href='http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_6.5.2.html'>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/atyourservice/en/displayFtu.html?ftuId=FTU_6.5.2.html</a> %} Stabilisation and Association Process{% endtooltip %}.

**The OSCE** has field operations in five Western Balkan countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Skopje. The mandates of missions cover a wide variety of fields, ranging from arms control to anti-discrimination.

**NGOs and civic society** are integral to successful conflict transformation processes. NGOs like {% tooltip An NGO established in Serbia that aims to promote European values and empower younger generations. %} Omladinski Odbor za Obrazovanje,{% endtooltip %} with financial support of the British Embassy in Serbia, annually organises the seminar {% tooltip Further information<a href='http://ooo.org.rs/en/omladinski-ambasadori-pomirenja/'>http://ooo.org.rs/en/omladinski-ambasadori-pomirenja/</a> %}"Youth Reconciliation Ambassadors"{% endtooltip %}. {% tooltip further information<a href='http://www.yihr.org/'>http://www.yihr.org/</a> %} Youth Initiative for Human Rights {% endtooltip %} is another civic initiative present in 5 former Yugoslav states that facilitates dialogue and exchange between youth in the region. Both international and local NGOs take an active role in initiating dialogue and facilitating reconciliation, yet there is very little coherence between their actions.

## Key Conflicts

**Disputed Bilateral Issues among Countries**

As shown in Table 1, the main remaining areas for dispute between former Yugoslav states are borderlines, missing and displaced persons, refugees and {% tooltip Sometimes defined more broadly as responsibility taken for the violent acts during the war %} Genocide lawsuits{% endtooltip %}. Additionally, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) is in ongoing debate with Greece in regards to its name.

**Identity**

In the aftermath of the conflict, a huge amount of Yugoslav people fled from their homes, becoming refugees in other Yugoslav states. Their integration was not so successful, for instance, Serbs who fled to Croatia in beginning of 1990s only managed to obtain Croatian citizenship in the 2000s. Another problematic identity group are Roma people that had citizenship of Yugoslavia, yet after the breakup of the country, they have no prospects of obtaining new passports, leaving them stateless.

**Internationalisation of {% tooltip International Centre for Transitional Justice defines the concept as follows: '...

The entrance of international actors on the Balkan scene was identified as "the most promising incentive for the enhancement of post-conflict reconciliation in the region" {% tooltip Rupnik, J. ‘Les Balkans et la Pax Europea’.

With the ICTY taking the lead in prosecuting war criminals, the EU fostering the SAP in the region and starting initiatives like EULEX, most, if not all, transitional justice processes in Western Balkans are handled by foreign stakeholders. However, the ICTY is {% tooltip Further information <a href='http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/un-debate-turns-as-criticism-of-the-icty'>http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/un-debate-turns-as-criticism-of-the-icty</a> %} widely perceived as unfair, partial and subjective by people in the former Yugoslavia{% endtooltip %} . {% tooltip Further information <a href='http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2015&mm=04&dd=15&nav_id=93806'>http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes.php?yyyy=2015&mm=04&dd=15&nav_id=93806</a> , <a href='http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21632598-eus-mission-kosovo-ensnared-corruption-claims-small-balkan-scandal'>http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21632598-eus-mission-kosovo-ensnared-corruption-claims-small-balkan-scandal</a> %} Furthermore, EULEX was investigated in a number of corruption trials{% endtooltip %}. International attempts to handle local problems might seem effective from an international perspective, while remaining actively questioned and mistrusted from a local standpoint.

## Measures in place

### Transitional Justice

**Criminal Prosecutions**

War crimes prosecution is the most developed transitional justice mechanism in the region. Locally, prosecutions took place in specialized chambers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia. However, the quality of the prosecution’s was set unevenly. The ICTY, established in 1993 by the United Nations Security Council, is currently performing the function of investigating and prosecuting war crimes. Moreover, the Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution, often referred to as the **Kosovo Court**, is {% tooltip Further information: <a href='https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2016/01/15/kosovo-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague'>https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2016/01/15/kosovo-court-to-be-established-in-the-hague</a> %} expected to be established in The Hague later in 2016{% endtooltip %}. This institution will prosecute crimes committed by participants of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during 1999-2000, one of the serious allegations that the court ambitions to examine is {% tooltip Further information <a href='http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-organ-trafficking-how-the-claims-were-exposed-09-04-2015-1'>http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-organ-trafficking-how-the-claims-were-exposed-09-04-2015-1</a>  %} organ-trafficking{% endtooltip %}.

**Truth-seeking initiatives**

National initiatives to investigate the root causes of committed war crimes {% tooltip the Yugoslav Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2001 ended without delivering the final report; the Commission for Establishing Truth on the Fates of Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks, Jews, and Others in Sarajevo did not achieve any of the set goals and closed in 1995; Commissions for missing persons in BiH, Croatia, Serbia and Kosovo are inefficient in identifying missing persons. %} failed to perform their {% endtooltip %} functions. In 2005, {% tooltip RECOM website:<a href='http://www.recom.link/'>http://www.recom.link/</a> %} Regional Commission on Establishing the Facts in the Former Yugoslavia (RECOM){% endtooltip %} was established to serve as a facilitator for social debate and to establish facts about the past.

**Reparations**

Reparations to victims of war conflicts may be in form of financial compensation, memorials and restitution of rights. International Organisation for Migration (IOM)’s report on {% tooltip Retrieved from<a href='https://www.iom.int/files/live/sites/iom/files/What-We-Do/docs/Reparations-for-Wartime-Victimes-in-the-Former-Yugoslavia-In-Search-of-the-Way-Forward.pdf'>https://www.iom.int/files/live/sites/iom/files/What-We-Do/docs/Reparations-for-Wartime-Victimes-in-the-Former-Yugoslavia-In-Search-of-the-Way-Forward.pdf</a> %} Reparations for Wartime in Former Yugoslavia{% endtooltip %} estimates, that as of 2012, there is a total of 40,000 persons that went missing during the war times, with 14,000 still being unaccounted for. The report concludes efforts in reparations to be insufficient, further calling for an establishment of a comprehensive approach.

### Dialogue

{% tooltip More about the project can be found here<a href='http://ectr.eu/en-projects-and-initiatives/world-forum-let-my-people-live'>http://ectr.eu/en-projects-and-initiatives/world-forum-let-my-people-live</a> %}The Balkan Reconciliation Initiative (BRI){% endtooltip %} organised by The European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation together with German Foundations the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the Robert Bosch Stiftung. The BRI served as a **platform for dialogue among political leaders** of the Western Balkans. The conference emphasised the importance of tolerance as the key feature for social stability in a growingly multi-ethnic Europe for peaceful collaboration and development. Moreover, it concluded that political leadership, education and legal solutions all play crucial role in peaceful coexistence of various nations and religions.

**Dialogue among youth** is actively fostered by a number of NGOs and international donors. {% tooltip Kosić, A. & Livi, S. (2013). A Study of Perceived Parental Communication and Propensity towards Reconciliation among Youth in Vukovar (Croatia). Retrieved from<a href='http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2012/Kosic.pdf'>http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2012/Kosic.pdf</a> %} A case study {% endtooltip %} conducted by Kosić and Livi in Croatia focused on factors influencing openness to reconciliation among high school students has identified that positive parental communication is most associated with reconciliation, and significantly more so than with sense of victimhood.
