## Relevance and Explanation of the Issue

Around 1000 years ago, a new group of people arrived in Eastern Europe. They called themselves the "Romani", although their division across the continent resulted in many branches with different names and cultures. Although originally from the region which today forms Northern India, culturally they were never bound to any ancient or distant homeland. Hence, they travelled the lands, visiting many cities but never really settling anywhere. The Roma people were never truly understood and were always considered minorities and outcasts. Yet while {% tooltip hate and discrimination aimed specifically at the Romani, similar to anti semitism %}antiziganism{% endtooltip %} has led to the persecution of many Romani throughout the ages, they were able to survive and live their lives to a greater or lesser extent.

However, after the second world war and the {% tooltip The 'Romani Holocaust' in the Nazi empire, the genocide of up to half a million Roma %}Porjamos{% endtooltip %}, there has been ever less place for the typical Roma life in European societies. Especially in the parts of Eastern Europe under Soviet influence, communism made it very difficult for the Roma to survive, and the legal means of generating income available to them {% tooltip For a very brief overview of Romani history, visit <a href='https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/gypsies-roma-travellers-animated-history'>https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/gypsies-roma-travellers-animated-history</a> %}diminished{% endtooltip %}.

Antiziganism is still prominent in Europe. For instance, in July 2010, the French government started a programme to demolish camps of Roma from Romanian and Bulgarian origin. Since the [Schengen agreement](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Al33020) allows free travel between EU Member States, these actions did not conform to European law, but the fact that France pursued their plans anyway proves that the Roma still have a hard time integrating, and that the situation is problematic for both the Roma and the rest of the population of Europe.

Many Roma are not registered with municipalities as citizens. Due to this, many of them have to live in illegal camps and make a living from illegal activities. This creates a lot of tension and mistrust between authorities and the Roma. They get more segregated and their opportunities to break out of this vicious circle get weaker still. Often are they forced to migrate and to set up new makeshift camps, where the conditions are even worse.

Meanwhile, many Roma are quite attached to their culture. Family and belonging to the group are considered to be very important values, and those who do not conform to their own cultural standards are considered {% tooltip Translates to 'non-Romani'. Rather than just an ethnic description, a Gadjo is someone considered not to have a Romanipen, or “Romani soul” %}Gadjo{% endtooltip %}. This self-induced segregation of the Roma has led to stereotyping amongst those who don’t understand the culture, which obstructs inclusion into society even more.

In short, the Roma currently do not function as a part of society, yet due to their lifestyle, culture and discrimination by authorities they will always stay a minority in other countries for as long as they exist. Hence, the true question is which place they can and should have in modern Europe, and how both their basic human and cultural rights can be protected.

## Key Questions

* Why is Roma inclusion still a problem in Europe despite various efforts by multiple organisations regarding their integration?

* Up until what point are the Roma willing to integrate more into the rest of society?

* How can governments ensure that Roma integrate into society up to this minimal point?

* Which aspects of integration are necessary for the Roma to function as a subculture in the regions they live in?

* How can governments give those Romani who wish to participate more in society the opportunity to do so without suffering from discrimination?

## Key Facts & Figures

* The number of Romani in Europe is {% tooltip  <a href='http://www.coe.int/nl/web/portal/roma/'>http://www.coe.int/nl/web/portal/roma/</a>  %} estimated between 10 and 12 million{% endtooltip %}, making it Europe’s greatest minority. The estimates differ so much because many Roma do not register with their municipality.

* The Roma have a rich history of travelling, and are nearly unique as a people for not having any claimed ancestral or mythical territory.

* The Roma often form very strong communities. The Romanipen, or Roma soul, is a core concept in Roma culture, and family and hierarchy are often considered important values.

* The Roma have been stigmatised frequently and extensively throughout the history of Europe.

* The Porajmos (Romani Holocaust) still is a very relevant element of the Roma identity.

* The Roma tend to be poorly educated, and if they enroll their children in education, they are very often sent to schools for special needs children.

* Many Roma are unemployed, and it has proven hard for them to find work, both by themselves and through special government programmes.

* The majority of the Roma live well below the poverty line.

* Many Roma do not have access to healthcare, and their life expectancy is significantly below the rest of Europe.

* Although many national governments and NGOs have made attempts to include the Roma into society, their situation has not significantly improved over the past decade.

## Key Actors

**OSCE**

According to it’s [website](http://www.osce.org/what/roma), "The OSCE promotes the rights of Roma and Sinti through projects on political participation, education, housing, civil registration, combating racism and discrimination, and protecting the rights of displaced persons." Their main activities are the deployment of field missions, which try to combat discrimination, to educate about the Roma, their history and the Porajmos, and to provide education for the Roma themselves.

**EU**

The role of the EU in this issue is quite limited. Education, health and culture are supportive [competences](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Aai0020) of the EU, which means that policy is made at the National level or lower. However, the EU has decided these issues are a key point in its Roma inclusion programmes. Therefore, the EU supports the efforts of Member States through guidelines and centralising dialogue. A key part of this is the {% tooltip A summary of their last meeting and more information about their work can be found at <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/roma-platform-2015/platformconclusions_en.htm#v'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/roma-platform-2015/platformconclusions_en.htm#v</a> %}European Platform for Roma Inclusion{% endtooltip %}, which aims at creating a dialogue between the different stakeholders regarding effective Roma inclusion policy and its implementation.

**International Romani Union**

Less than half a century ago, the Roma were unified by cultural similarity, but not united through any kind of organisation. Hence, the International Romani Union (IRU) was established in 1978 at the first World Romani Congress. According to it’s own [website](http://internationalromaniunion.org/about-us/), the IRU aims "to represent all Roma policy in the world (Roma, Sinti, lovara, kederara, xoraxane, romunge, etc.) and act for the best interests of the Roma nation". Most national Roma organisations and interest groups are to some extent related to this international organ, which currently has {% tooltip Albania, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, England, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Kosovo, Latvia , Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine %}34 Member States{% endtooltip %}. Until the 20th of March 2016, the President of the organisation was [Dorin Cioaba]([https://news.vice.com/article/an-audience-with-the-king-of-the-gypsies](https://news.vice.com/article/an-audience-with-the-king-of-the-gypsies)), who after his election crowned himself “King of Gypsies all over the World’. He has since been replaced by Zoran Dimov. Their [charter](http://internationalromaniunion.org/charter-ertf-roma-rights/) regarding the fundamental rights of the Roma provides some insight in who they consider themselves to be and which issues they consider to be most important regarding their acceptance into society as a “Nation” spread of various countries.

## Key Conflicts

There are several reasons why the Roma are unable to get a more stable position in society. First of all, there is the problem of **stigmatisation** throughout European societies. Being the largest minority in Europe there are many prejudices surrounding the group, which makes is difficult for them to fit into society. Furthermore, their inability to speak the language of the country they reside in and the value of protecting their own group and family lead to the Roma never truly interacting with anyone else and vice versa. This form of **social segregation** reinforces itself.

Because the Roma often aren’t **registered**, it becomes hard for them to get access to **employment**, **education** and **healthcare**. Since they often have no legal source of income, they often must make a living through either petty or more serious forms of **crime**, the latter of which targets both Roma, non-Roma, and society in general. Meanwhile, such criminal behaviour significantly reinforces stereotypes.

Most Roma are very proud of their culture and their {% tooltip 'Romani soul', an abstract concept which is attributed to all those who are raised by the Roma, who adhere to Romani culture and who are part of the “Romani Nation” %}Romanipen{% endtooltip %}. Many efforts by authorities to integrate the Roma into society are rejected because many of them feel like this means betraying their **cultural heritage**. If some people in the group decide to cooperate with integration efforts, this might be seen as cultural betrayal by their peers, and since family is a key value in Romani culture, the problem remains.

All these problems reinforce each other, which has led to the current situation. The Roma are stuck in a vicious circle which is kept intact by both parties, and the key elements necessary for resolving the conflict are finding common ground and starting with the things that are possible.

## Measures in place

### Action Plan OSCE

The OSCE has developed an [action plan on improving the situation of the Roma and Sinti within the OSCE area](http://www.osce.org/odihr/17554), since 2003. This plan contains guidelines for Roma inclusion policies of Member States who while implementing the plan should always: "(1) respond to the real problems, needs and priorities of Roma and Sinti communities; (2) be comprehensive; (3) introduce a balanced and sustainable approach to combining human rights goals with social policies; and (4) maximize Roma ownership of the policies that affect them." Furthermore, it contains action plans and policies the OECD will enforce by itself through its subdivisions and {% tooltip More information on recent field work of the OSCE can be found at <a href='http://www.osce.org/stories/'>http://www.osce.org/stories/</a> %} field operations {% endtooltip %}. The core elements are:

* anti-discrimination

* improved police relations

* media campaigns

* housing

* living conditions

* employment

* healthcare

* education to and about the Roma

* ensuring that all Roma are registered and have the necessary official legal documents to partake in society.

Ten years later, the OSCE wrote a [report](http://www.osce.org/odihr/107406) on the implementation of the action plan, which provides some insight in the effectiveness of policy.

### EU framework and Member State programmes

Similar to the OSCE, the Council of the European Union has written a [framework](http://register.consilium.europa.eu/doc/srv?l=EN&f=ST%2010658%202011%20INIT) for the actions Member States should take to combat Roma exclusion together. This framework stems from 2011, and focuses on four key areas: education, employment, health and housing. However, as stated previously, most competences and hence the responsibility to combat the problems related to Roma exclusion are with the Member States, and hence the EU itself can do but very little than recommend policies and keep track of progress. A report on the [implementation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52015DC0299&from=FR) of the framework from 2015 does the latter for individual Member States. What the EU has also done is setting up the {% tooltip For a report on their last meeting see <a href='http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/roma-platform-2015/files/romaplatform2015report_en.pdf'>http://ec.europa.eu/justice/events/roma-platform-2015/files/romaplatform2015report_en.pdf</a> %} European Platform for Roma Inclusion {% endtooltip %}, which plays a vital role in the facilitation of a dialogue between Member States, NGOs and various Roma organisations.

### The Decade of Roma Inclusion

[The Decade of Roma Inclusion](http://www.romadecade.org/), which ran from 2005 to 2015, was a cooperative effort between the {% tooltip Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Spain %}ten European countries{% endtooltip %} with the greatest relative Roma population. Although focussing on the four aspects which policy makers often consider the greatest predicaments of the Romani population (health, education, employment and housing), and despite extensive efforts made by the participating countries to include the Roma into society, the project has been generally regarded as [unsuccesfull](http://www.romadecade.org/cms/upload/file/9809_file1_final-lostdecade.pdf). The main criticisms laid out in this paper are that the decade did not have clearly specified goals and that its failure merely served to put Roma inclusion higher on the European agenda, by showcasing the difficulty of solving the problem. It calls for the participating nations to put more effort into fighting the discrimination and exclusion.
